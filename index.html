      <h2>Hello there.</h2>
      <p class="intro">Dear Customer, please be aware that we do hire people with special needs to be cashiers and other sorts of jobs, so please be kind and considerate when talking to them. We will support various charities to help aid people who are in need and people who have special needs. If you wish to donate, go to the cashier to donate, but if you're ordering online, you still can donate online with a donation option in the ordering form. Finally, enjoy your meal and have a nice day!           -  The Mmm Pizza Team</p>
